			<dd>I don't really feel like doing much today, but had a good jiggle throughout the day though. I had a nice quick visit from my Papa this morning (I could hear his geordie accent!).</dd>

			<dd>I was tempted a bit yesterday evening during and after dinner making it difficult for Mummmy to walk around. I went to sleep last night though and I've made it a little bit easier for Mummmy again this morning, but I think she's feeling a little sore from all my escapades yesterday. Still happy in here though.</dd>

			<dd>Had an Indian tonight, it was tasty. I'll stay in here if the service stays this good&hellip;</dd>

			<dd>Mummy says it's quite nice outside, but I'll just stay in here. Still digesting my yummy egg sandwich lunch.</dd>

			<dd>Another good night sleep last night. Mummy fed me porridge with banana on. It's a lovely day out there today, I'll have a think about coming out to play but I'm happy in my den at the minute.</dd>

			<dd>They tried, they failed. Target remains.</dd>

			<dd>What on Earth has just been put near my head? Get it off me please!</dd>
			 
<dt><strong>10/04/2020 20:57</strong> <span class="uk-label uk-margin-left">In utero</span></dt>
			<dd>Just sat in the hospital chilling. Getting a bit bored in here not knowing if I'm being forced out or not, I'd rather stay in here though.</dd>

			<dd>Saw the midwife yesterday and she tried to entice me out, but I still prefer it in here. I'm off to the hospital today at dinner time, I think they are going to try and force me out a bit more. I'll be staying in here as long as I can though; I love kicking mummies tummy really hard and there is a nerve I like pressing on as it makes mummy stop and bendover, it makes me giggle.</dd>
			 
<dt><strong>09/04/2020 09:09</strong> <span class="uk-label uk-margin-left">In utero</span></dt>
			<dd>I'm looking forward to seeing the midwife in a bit, they are still trying to get me out!</dd>

			<dd>Mummy says it's another lovely day outside. I'm moving around and having a big stretch, it's soooo cosy in here.</dd>

			<dd>Daddy says he was a bit busy earlier and couldn't let you know what I was doing, but I had t done much anyway. I went looking for bugs with my big sis and rolling around in Mummy's tummy. Mummy has got me some chocolate tonight! ðŸ˜€</dd>

			<dt><strong>07/04/2020 09:00</strong> <span class="uk-label uk-margin-left">In utero</span></dt>
			<dd>Not up to much at the minute. Mummy says it looks quite nice outside today.</dd>

			<dt><strong>06/04/2020 17:15</strong> <span class="uk-label uk-margin-left">In utero</span></dt>
			<dd>I don't really feel like doing much today, but had a good jiggle throughout the day though. I had a nice quick visit from my Papa this morning (I could hear his geordie accent!).</dd>

			<dt><strong>06/04/2020 08:10</strong> <span class="uk-label uk-margin-left">In utero</span></dt>
			<dd>I was tempted a bit yesterday evening during and after dinner making it difficult for Mummmy to walk around. I went to sleep last night though and I've made it a little bit easier for Mummmy again this morning, but I think she's feeling a little sore from all my escapades yesterday. Still happy in here though.</dd>

			<dd>Had an Indian tonight, it was tasty. I'll stay in here if the service stays this good&hellip;</dd>

			<dd>Mummy says it's quite nice outside, but I'll just stay in here. Still digesting my yummy egg sandwich lunch.</dd>

			<dt><strong>05/04/2020 09:24</strong> <span class="uk-label uk-margin-left">In utero</span></dt>
			<dd>Another good night sleep last night. Mummy fed me porridge with banana on. It's a lovely day out there today, I'll have a think about coming out to play but I'm happy in my den at the minute.</dd>

			<dt><strong>04/04/2020 20:40</strong> <span class="uk-label uk-margin-left">In utero</span></dt>
			<dd>I'm still in here, had a good night sleep last night and during the day. Happy in here atm. :)</dd>

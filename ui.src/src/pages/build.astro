                    <p>Tied closely to websites being fast, efficient websites really drive a users overall impression of a website. It's common knowledge that webpage speed greatly affects bounce rates, ecommerce conversion rates, and user experience, and the way websites are built are one of the main factors that affect page speed.</p>
                    <p>Poorly built websites that have no been carefully made, serving unnecessary/bloated resources and incorrect image sizes, and various other factors all play a major role in a website being efficient.</p>
